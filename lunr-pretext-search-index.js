  "title": "Review from Introductory Physics",
  "body": " Review from Introductory Physics  Electrical devices are powered by electricity, the movement of charges (which we call current ) through a circuit. These charges move due to voltage differences applied by batteries or power supplies. Thus, if we intend to understand the behavior of electrical circuits, we must first remember what we learned in our introductory physics course.  In the presence of charged objects, the space around the objects is altered. This alteration can be represented as a vector field which we call the electric field (which has SI units of V\/m). The electric field at a position relative to a point charge source is given by where is the permitivity of free space (a constant of nature). The electric field has SI units of V\/m. While the electric field is a useful construct, it can be convenient to represent this space modification using a scalar field called the electric potential (with SI units of Volts). For a point charge , the electric potential some distance away from the source charge is . When discussing circuits, this scalar field is often called the voltage . The relationship linking these two representations is described by . While both representations have their uses, voltage will be much more commonly used and referenced when analyzing the behavior of electrical circuits.  In circuits, voltage differences lead to electric fields that cause charges to move. Current quantifies the movement of charge through circuit components. More precisely, current is the amount of charge passing by some point in a circuit per unit time, or . In many materials (e.g. metals), positive charges are largely immobile since they are associated with the nuclei of atoms in a material. Thus, electrons are typically the charge carrier in circuits, constituting the current. Unfortunately, there was still much unknown about atomic theory when initial experiments on electricity were conducted, with the consequence that the direction of current is defined to be in the direction that positive charge carriers would be moving if they were responsible for the current. This means that current often has a direction that is opposite to the direction in which the actual charge carriers are moving.  "

In truth, these laws will extend beyond the DC circuit analysis presented in this chapter, but we will leave discussion of these extensions to future chapters.  Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), or Junction Law, relies on conservation of charge to say that the rate at which charges enter a junction must be equivalent to the rate at which charges leave the junction for a scenario as pictured in . The KCL can also be represented mathematically as where for currents leaving a node and for currents entering a node.    A circuit junction.   Another conservation law, the conservation of energy, is ultimately responsible for what we call Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), or the Loop Law. If one walks around any loop in a circuit (such as that shown in ), the sum of the voltage changes as one moves in a single direction around a complete loop must add up to zero, or When using the KVL equation, voltages rise as one crosses a voltage source from the negative terminal to positive terminal and voltages fall in the opposite direction. Additionally, voltages fall across a resistor in the direction of current and rise in the opposite direction.  A circuit loop.     The last rule we'll introduce here is Ohm's Law. For the situation shown in , the magnitude of the voltage change across a resistor is dependent on the resistance and the magnitude of current in the resistor according to where .

At node A, we apply the KCL to find The KVL can then be applied to Loop I and Loop II. Examining Loop I first, we will start in the lower left corner and traverse the loop in the direction indicated by the arrow. Traversing this loop has us pass through battery from the negative to positive terminal, resulting in . The next component that we encounter is , which we travel across in the direction of current, so Ohm's law tells us that the voltage falls by in the direction of current. Likewise, the voltage falls by as we travel across in the direction of current on the way back to our starting point. The KVL for Loop 1 will thus give where there are negative signs in front of and because voltage falls by these amount in the direction that we've traversed the loop. A similar application of the KVL to Loop II gives .  Often, voltages provided by batteries (or a DC voltage source) and the resistances are known as these were the physical components assembled into the circuit. Thus, - represent a series of equations that must be solved to determine currents in .  Rather than solving this system of equations for the three currents, we will instead perform some intermediate analysis to investigate the behavior of resistor combinations. Starting with , we can see that . Resistors and are considered to be in series . Resistors are in series if the current in one resistor must be the same current in the other series resistors. In this case, and are in series because must be the current through each of the resistors since there is no junction between them. We see that the voltage drop across the pair of series resistors is just where , meaning that resistors in series act together as a single resistor that has a resistance equal to the sum of the individual series resistances. This relationship holds for any number of resistors that are in series such that . This means that currents , , and will have identical values in all three circuits displayed in    Original circuit (left) is simplified into an intermediate circuit (center) by combining series resistors and into effective resistance . The circuit is further simplified (right) by combining parallel resistors and into effective resistance .  If we now examine the simplified circuit in b, we can see that both and both have the same voltage drop across them so that . These expressions can be inserted into to find so that . This has the form of Ohm's Law where and combine into an equivalent resistance . We say that resistors and are in parallel because the potential difference across each resistor must be identical as each side of the resistors are connected together by wires.

  "body": " Circuit Analysis Methods   In the following sections, we will analyze the DC circuit found in using a variety of different methods. Each of these methods can be useful in different circumstances, so these exercises are meant to introduce you to a variety of tools that will remain in your circuit-analysis toolbox for future use.  The circuit that will be analyzed using multiple different methods over the course of the following sections.       Analysis: Circuit Reduction  In the method of circuit reduction, we use the rules of series and parallel resistors to find all currents present in the circuit. We will start by drawing the circuit and labeling all currents as in a.  Circuit reduction for .   In our first simplification, we note that and are in parallel, so . With that simplification done, we now find that , , and are in series, so . Ohm's law can be used to find  where is the voltage change across . We must also check the direction of . When examining a circuit, you must sometimes guess at the directions of currents. If you guess correctly and the guessed current direction flows from high to low potential, then your value for current will be positive. If you guessed incorrectly at the outset, you will instead find that the value for current will be negative. In this situation, we note that the direction pictured does indeed pass through from high to low potential given how terminals are connected directly to battery terminals. Thus, the value that we calculate for should be positive. So, .  Now, in order to find currents and , we'll have to find the voltage changes across and . We can do this by taking our calculated value for and using Ohm's Law in (left). Thus, we find that . In other words, so that . Once we have , we can use Ohm's law to find and  . If we define , then .    Analysis: Branch Method  In the branch method , we perform the following steps:  Draw the circuit.  Define a current for each circuit segment that may have a different current. Use your intuition to try to guess the correct directions for the currents. Don't worry about guessing wrong. It is just important to clearly identify your assumed direction for each current.  Write out KCL equations at nodes. Remove duplicate or redundant equations. Note that the number of independent KCL equations is one fewer than the number of junctions present in the circuit.  Write down KVL equations for enough loops to include all circuit components at least once.  Solve the system of KCL and KVL equations for all unknown currents. If you were wrong in your initial guesses for any current directions, those currents will just come out with negative values.  Use Ohm's law to find voltage changes through each resistor and use those changes to find the voltage at any point of interest in the circuit.  To analyze the circuit in using the mesh method, we draw the circuit and define currents as in .  Branch method circuit analysis.   Examining the KCL at junction A and the KVL for loops I and II, we find the following equations You can now find values for , , and using your favorite method for solving systems of equations. We will illustrate several such methods.  Solving Branch Method Equations - Analytic   Solve - for the three unknown currents using analytic methods.    Solving Equation for , , and inserting into Equations and , we get which can be rearranged into . Solving the top equation for , we find which can be substituted into the bottom equation to give . Plugging in values for known components, we can solve for . Once we have a value for , we use the equations above to calculate and then , finding . Then, just as in the circuit reduction method, Ohm's law can be used to find .     Solving Branch Method Equations - Python  Solve - for the three unknown currents using Python.   The Python programming language can be used to solve a system of equations through the use of the scipy.linalg package. If presented with an equation where is a matrix and and are vectors, we can solve the equation using x = scipy.linalg.solve(A,v) .  As an example, let's start with the system of equations -  . These equations can be re-expressed as a matrix equation if we remember the rules of matrix multiplication (see for details). The resulting matrix equation is expressed as . Since we have numerical values for and all resistors, we can plug these into the matrices. This matrix equation is in the necessary form for x = scipy.linalg.solve(A,v) . The results of this method are identical to the analytic result.     Solving Branch Method Equations - Sympy  Solve - for the three unknown currents using Python and SymPy.   One can also use functionality from SymPy, the symbolic math package for Python, to solve systems of linear equations. As before, becomes which can be solved symbolically with the following code: This analysis gives the result which simplifies to the results of the previous methods when numerical values are inserted for and resistances.     Solving Branch Method Equations - Gaussian elimination   Solve - for the three unknown currents using Gaussian elimination.    We can also use a linear algebra method called Gaussian elimination to solve the matrix equation . Gaussian elimination relies on two facts:  If we multiply one row of and the same row of by some constant , the solutions for remain unchanged.  Any linear combination of two rows will give a new correct row.  Using the two rules above, our goal is to find an equivalent such that . Often, the first step in using Gaussian elimination is to divide the first row by . In this case, both and remain unchanged since . Next, we'll subtract from row 2 to get . Then, we'll subtract from row 3 to get . If we now divide row 2 by , we get Subtracting from row 3 will eliminate while leaving  . Then, divide row 3 by to get which simplifies to . Now, we can read off an expression for and subsequently calculate and  .       Analysis: Mesh Method  In the mesh method , we perform the following steps:  Draw the circuit.  Define mesh currents . Each current passes around a complete loop. Every component must be in at least one loop. Typically, it is best to use the simplest loops possible. The total current passing through any point in the circuit is the sum of the mesh currents through that point. Choose and clearly indicate each current loop's direction; the direction chosen doesn't really matter as long as it is clearly defined.  Write down a KVL equation for each loop. If there are multiple mesh currents passing through a resistor, the voltage change is the sum of voltage changes for each mesh current through that component. The signs for each voltage drop contribution result in voltage drops for the mesh currents aligned with the direction we go around the loop for the loop law, while they result in voltage rises for the mesh currents aligned against the direction we go around the loop when creating the loop law equation.  Solve the system of KVL equations for all unknown mesh currents.  The current through any point in the circuit is the sum of mesh currents through that point. Note that two mesh currents through a point on the circuit will add together with opposite signs.  Use Ohm's law to find voltage changes through each resistor and use those changes to find the voltage at any point of interest in the circuit.  One of the benefits of the mesh method over the branch method is that there are fewer equations to solve in the resulting system of equations (since there is no KCL equation), though this comes at the cost of having to add multiple mesh currents together to find the total current through any point in the circuit.  The analysis begins with drawing the circuit and defining our mesh currents as demonstrated in .  Mesh method circuit analysis.   Then, the KVL equations associated with mesh currents and are which can be arranged into the form . Once again, your favorite method for solving systems of equations can be used to find the mesh currents mA and mA. Therefore, the current passing through , , and is mA clockwise, the current through is mA downward, and the current through is mA downward. With these current values, we can once again use the same Ohm's law method from the previous sections to find the voltages at any location in the circuit.  Note that the mesh method leaves us with a system of two equations to solve and compare that to the system of three equations that the branch method provided. This simplification comes at a cost, though. In the branch method, the variables representing currents are the actual currents passing through each part of the circuit. In the mesh method, we instead solve for mesh currents. The real currents can then be calculated as sums and differences of these mesh currents.   "

Before stating the superposition theorem, we must first establish a few definitions.  First, linear circuit elements are circuit elements for which the relationship between voltage and current is a linear function. Examples of linear circuit elements include resistors, capacitors, and inductors. A linear circuit contains only linear elements.  With these definitions in place, the superposition theorem states that for any linear circuit containing more than one independent source, the circuit can be solved for one source while turning the others `off'. Then, this can be repeated for each source and add the results together. When we talk about turning a voltage source off, we mean that we replace it in our analysis with a wire. Turning a current source off means replacing the current source with a break in the circuit. The superposition theorem in electronics arises directly from use of the superposition principle in electricity and magnetism.   "

  "title": "Thevenin and Norton Theorem",
  "body": " Thevenin and Norton Theorem         Circuits controlling devices that you use every day are often very complex with complicated scematic diagrams. This complexity can make it difficult to analytically determine the behavior of the output voltage and current when this complex circuit is connected to an external load. DEFINE LOAD.  In this section, we introduce two theorems that allow us to replace a complicated circuit with a simplified circuit (either the Thevenin equivalent circuit or the Norton equivalent circuit). The original and simplified circuits all have output voltages and currents that behave identically when an external load is connected across the outputs.    Proof of Thevenin's and Norton's Theorems  Let's assume that inside of a box we have a circuit with two leads exiting the box ( ). The circuit in the box is comprised of a complicated network of resistors , DC voltage sources , and ideal current sources . We will also assume unknown currents that are dependent on the size of the externally-applied voltage across the output terminals of the circuit.      Let's assume that if we apply the branch circuit analysis method, we end up with independent junction law equations and loop law equations. Each junction law equation will have the form where and have values of +1, -1, or 0 depending on whether the currents and are entering, exiting, or not present at a junction and is an index counting over KCL equations.  We will also end up with independent loop law equations. All loops chosen for KVL analysis must be absent known current sources . Since the current is already known on circuit legs containing circuit sources, so this restriction will not cost us anything. Each of these loop law equations will have the form . The variables have values of either +1, or -1 depending on the battery orientation relative to the direction travelled around the loop, or a value of 0 for batteries not present in a given loop. Variable has units of resistance (since each nonzero term in these sums represents a voltage change described by Ohm's Law). Here, the index counts over KVL equations.  These instances of and instances of can be re-expressed as a matrix equation . First, let's rearrange these equations so that all unknowns are on the left side of the equation and all of the source terms are on the right . We can express these equations in the form if we let , . Now, every element in matrix is either a unitless number or a function of resistances only. More to the point, there is no voltage or current dependence in . If we multiply both sides of our matrix equation by , we get . The solution that is most important to us is as we wish to examine the relationship between output current and voltage. If we actually perform the calculations necessary to invert , use matrix multiplication to find an expression for , and then group source terms and rename constants multiplying each source ( ), the resulting solution is of the form where all and terms are functions of resistances only and are thus constants. This result demonstrates that is a linear function of with slope and a y-intercept that equals the two summations on the right side of the equation. So, we have now shown that any circuit comprised of solely linear circuit elements is itself a linear circuit.  Now that the linearity of our complicated circuit has been demonstrated, it follows that any simplified circuit that follows an identical linear relationship will have behavior of and that is identical to the original circuit, regardless of the load that is connected across the output terminals. One such simplified circuit is the Thevenin equivalent circuit of . The Thevenin equivalent circuit will reproduce the output i-v relationship of our complicated circuit if . In a similar way, we can see that the Norton equivalent circuit can also demonstrate identical output i-v behavior when .  The behavior of linear circuits is shown graphically in .   I-V plot for linear circuits.    At this point, it is important to discuss that the internal behavior of the complicated circuit and simplified circuit are different. EXPAND ON THIS THOUGHT.    Finding Thevenin Equivalent Circuits  Given a complicated circuit, we can use the procedure provided in the proof above to find Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuit parameters.   Thevenin Example - Matrix Approach   Coming soon.  Here, we develop and , convert them into a matrix equation, and use Python to solve for the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuit parameters.    Coming soon    If one wishes to find Thevenin and Norton equivalent parameters analytically, it is often easier to follow this procedure:   Use circuit analysis to find the open-circuit voltage which is equivalent to when nothing is connected externally between output terminals A and B. Then, .    Find which is equivalent to when all internal source voltages and currents are `turned off'.   Turning a source `off' means replacing voltage sources with wires and replacing current sources with breaks.    This method works as a consequence of application of the superposition theorem to the complicated circuit.       Use your values for and to find      Let's look at an example.   Thevenin Example - No Linear Algebra   Find , , and for the circuit in .                  Find Assume an open circuit between terminals A and B such that . Using mesh analysis, we find or . Then . Thus, the voltage difference across is .

Find : If we turn off all sources in our circuit, we are left to find the resistance between terminals A and B in . Looking for series and parallel resistances, we find that . Plugging in resistance values, we find that .   Find : The Norton current mA.    Sometimes, one does not have a circuit schematic but only has the physical circuit. In this case, a digital multimeter can be used to physically perform the following procedure:   Find the open-circuit voltage which is equivalent to when nothing is connected externally between output terminals A and B. Then, .    Find the short-circuit current which is the current from terminal A to terminal B when an external wire connects the two outputs. Then .    The Thevenin resistance (which is equivalent to the Norton resistance) is then .     Look at section 41.6 to add color to example blocks. also section 28.2 and similar. xsl stylesheets   "

Since any general (well-behaved) function of time can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal signals, we can use the superposition theorem to find the response of a linear circuit to a general time signal. If we examine the behavior of a linear circuit in response to a single sinusoidal signal with frequency , we can then use superposition to add up (integrate) responses for many sinusoidal signals (each with its own ), weighting the results in the sum using the same weighting factors that appear above.

  "title": "Input and Output Impedance",
  "body": " Input and Output Impedance  Let's revisit Thevenin's theorem and Norton's theorem. Both of these theorems remain valid when working with AC signals as long as we substitute impedances for resistances. Here, we'll focus our attention on the usefulness of Thevenin's theorem.  Thevenin's theorem states that the output voltage and current characteristics of a complicated circuit are identical to output characteristics of a simplified Thevenin-equivalent circuit ( ) for proper choice of Thevenin voltage and impedance.     Here, we provide an example demonstrating the importance of Thevenin's theorem.  An LRC circuit connected to a function generator.     The complicated internal circuitry of a function generator will be equivalent to a single internal voltage source and a single internal impedance . This internal impedance can be found on specification sheets for modern function generators, often labeled as output impedance . Most commonly, function generators have an output impedance of , though some (like those built into prototyping boards) may have output impedances up to several hundred ohms.  The input impedance characterizes a circuit's output voltage and current characteristics based on the load that is applied across the output. A circuit's input impedance characterizes how hard the circuit is to drive and is equivalent to the load circuit's .  Let's use the example in to illustrate the meanings associated with the descriptions above. In this case, the load circuit is an inductor, a capacitor, and a resistor in series, so that . Now, if the load circuit is connected across the output of the function generator, we end up with a voltage-divider circuit as seen in . This means we can use that chapter's result while replacing resistances with impedances, so . We find that is minimized when which occurs when . We draw the following conclusions:   For signal frequencies far from the resonant frequency , meaning that .    When , we will find that and are very different if    We demonstrate this behavior by plotting the signal being produced at the output of the function generator as a function of frequency For the parameters specified in .      Now, this has important consequences. First, extra care must be taken if one were to be studying voltage gain and phase properties of the pictured load circuit. If one were to trust the signal amplitude displayed on the function generator for when calculating voltage gain values, these values would be grossly incorrect for frequencies near the resonance frequency because both and vary with frequency.  These concepts also impact the design of oscilloscopes. If we want to use an oscilloscope to measure the voltage output of a function generator, we want the oscilloscope to have a very high impedance so that the oscilloscope leaves the function generator output voltage unchanged across all frequencies.  So, input and output impedances for circuits is an important consideration when determining how a load circuit will impact the behavior of the driving circuit. We determine Thevenin equivalent circuit values for both the driving and load circuits in order to determine the input and output impedances of these circuits. Input and output impedances are also critical to consider when working at high frequencies (MHz and above). At these high frequencies, impedance matching (or matching input and output impedances of linked circuits) is needed to miminize signal reflections and maximize power transfer. This text will limit it's treatment to sub-MHz frequencies and will not treat these effects.  "

  "body": " Semiconductors  As the name suggets, semiconductors have conductivity between ocnductors and insulators. Semiondur properties have made many important electrical advances possible.   diodes    transistors    operational amplifiers    integrated circuit chips    Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)    photodiodes.     In order to understand semiconductors, we must examine the atomic structure of these materials and how they relate to molecular bonds. Let's start with which shows the energy levels for two isolated atoms.      Quantum mechanics tells us that electrons can occupy discrete energy levels of an atom. Energy levels fill starting with the lowest and fill upward. Electrons occupying high energy levels are further from the nucleus and also have a larger spatial extent surrounding the nucleus compared to electrons in low energy levels, at least on average. Elecrons of course do not behave like macroscopic objects with definite position, but instead are represented by electron clouds. For the purposes of this class, we will not have to trouble ourselves with this level of detail.  In the atom pictured in , the energy levels represented by solid lines are occupied by electrons, with the term valence electrons used to identify electrons in the highest occupied energy level. The dashed lines represent empty energy levels.  When these two formerly isolated items are brought close to each other such that the valence electron orbitals start overlapping, the pair of atoms can reach a lower energy state by sharing some of their valence electrons. These shared energy levels develop into bands rather than precise discrete levels. Fuller details about the physics of covalent bonds can be found in many Modern Physics or Quantum Mechanics textbooks but will be unnecessary for us. provides a rough picture of the elements important to us.     In this figure, the valence band represents the last occupied energy band at Kelvin. The conduction band is the next energy band above the valence band, and the band gap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band.  Now, these last three terms are critical to understanding the difference between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, as illustrated in .     We see that conductors have overlapping valence and conduction bands. This means that the valence electrons, which are most loosely held by the nucleus due to their distance from the nucleus, can move relatively easily from one atom to the other using the empty orbital positions in the conduction band. In insulators, it is difficult to move valence electrons between atoms since those electrons would need to gain a large amount of energy to jump across the large bandgap from the valence to conduction band.  Semicondcuctors have non-overlapping valence and conduction bands, but with only a small bandgap between them. This means that at K, the semiconductor behaves like an insulator. But, at higher temperatures, there is enough thermal energy present that a small population of electrons that had been occupying the valence band instead make the jump into the conduction band and can now move freely.  One common semiconductor material is silicon Si which has an electron configuration that can be represented by . This means that Silicon has a full ground state (two electrons in the 1s orbital), a full second energy level (two electrons in the 2s orbital and six electrons in the 2p orbital), and a third energy level with electrons occupying half of the eight available orbital spots (two spots in the 3s orbital and six spots in the 3p orbital). shows a silicon crystal.  Silicon crystal. The shared electrons in covalent bonds fill the valence shell of the silicon crystal.   In this crystal, each Si atom is surrounded by eight electrons in the valence band, completely filling it. Each bond is formed by two electrons being shared between a pair of atoms, with each atom contributing one of the two shared electrons.  Now, on its own, silicon is a rather poor semiconductor. That said, the semiconductor properties of a Silicon crystal is improved significantly through doping. The term doping represents the process of mixing a small amount of an impurity into the silicon crystal.  There are two types of doping that are imporant to us here, and they are represented in .  Doped semiconductors.    n-type semiconductor.     p-type semiconductor.     In a doped n-type semiconductor , a small amount of phosphorus is added as an impurity into the silicon crystal. Phosphorus has five valence electrons in contrast to the four valence electrons that silicon has. This means that there are nine electrons trying to occupy the eight available spots in the valence band as shown in . Consequently, each ninth phosphorus electron is bumped up into the shared conducting band and can move freely. This is called an n-type semiconductor because negatively-charged electrons are the charge carrier , meaning they are the moving charged particles that comprise any current flowing through the semiconductor.  In a doped p-type semiconductor , a small amount of Boron is added as an impurity into the silicon crystal. Phosphorus has three valence electrons in contrast to the four valence electrons that silicon has. This means that there are seven electrons trying to occupy the eight available spots in the valence band, leaving an open orbital spot in the valence bqand as shown in . Consequently, the holes formed from the missing electron exist in the valence band and represent open spaces into which electrons can move. The reason this is called a p-type semiconductor is pictured in        In this figure, a valence electron feels a force due to the applied voltages and moves to fill the hole (step 1), resulting in a new hole at the electron's former position. This process repeats (step 2) with a different electron moving into the hole location, again swapping places. This continues through steps 3 and 4. The reality of the situation has four electrons each moving one space. it is convenient, instead, to treat the hole (the absence of an electron) as a single positive (relative to an electron) charge that moves four spaces to the left due to the applied voltage, just as a positive charge would move. As such, this hole (which we are treating akin to a positive charge) is considered the charge carrier and can move somewhat freely through the valence band of the semiconductor crystal.  "

  "title": "Diode behavior",
  "body": " Diode behavior  When we put p-type and n-type semiconductors together as in , we get a diode . When a voltage difference is applied across the diode, interesting behaviors can be observed.     Forward-biased.        Reverse biased.        When the voltage is applied across the diode as in , we say the diode is forward-biased . Valence-band holes in the valence band of the p-type semiconductor and conduction-band electrons in the n-type semiconductor move toward the pn junction. At the junction, electrons in the n-type semiconductor fall across the pn junction into p-type semiconductor holes. Since the valence band is a lower energy level than the conduction band, this is accomplished easily. Electrons are also pulled out of the p-type into the wire, generating more valence-band holes. These electrons travel through the circuit and replenish the conduction-band electrons when they enter the n-type semiconductor. This process can proceed indefinitely, resulting in sustained current flow through the diode.  If the bias is reversed as in , we say the diode is reverse-biased . In this case, valence-band holes and conduction-band electrons move away from the pn junction in their respective semiconductors. While electrons can leave the n-type semiconductor, travel through the circuit, and fill the holes in the p-type semiconductor, this will quickly come to a halt because no new holes are formed at the p-n boundary.  Using the behaviors observed above, we find that diodes act similar to one-directional wires. The behavior is captured in .       In this figure, is the voltage drop across the diode. When , the diode is off meaning no current flows through the diode and it acts as a circuit break. When , the diode is on meaning the diode starts acting like a wire, albiet with a voltage drop in the direction of current. In this cartoon picture, the voltage drop across the diode will remain as long as the diode is on regardless of the size of the current through the diode. Likewise, a diode that is off will allow no current regardless of the voltage change applied across the diode. Thus, a diode acts a bit like a unidirectional wire, allowing current to flow in one direction but not the other.  In the above discussion, we see that a diode turns on when the applied voltage drop across the diode reaches a value of , which we call the forward turn-on voltage . More colloquially, it is often referred to as the diode voltage drop . The origin of this diode voltage drop will be developed below.  Both p-type and n-type semiconductors are neutral when the voltage applied across them is zero, meaning each semiconductor individually has no excess of positive or negative charges. Let's now examine the situation in where we have a forward-biased diode.       The p-n junction is used for the boundary between the semiconductors. The bias voltage creates an applied electric field in the diode, accelerating charge carriers toward the p-n junction. Conduction-band electrons in the n-type semiconductor fall across the p-n junction into valence-band holes. It takes some finite time for the charge carriers to redistribute in each semiconductor, resulting in the formation of a thin depletion layer (indicated by dashed lines). Inside the boundary of this depletion layer, there is a deficit of electrons in the n-type semiconductor and a surplus of electrons in the p-type semiconductor, resulting in a second electric field within the depletion layer. If the depletion layer is characterized by thickness , then this results in a voltage difference . In order for charge carriers to redistribute and maintain a current, we must have . This means that the applied voltage bias must be at least as large as some in order to generate an applied electric field that is larger than and can sustain the requisite charge carrier motions to maintain a current through the diode. [CLEAN THIS LAST PART UP. How are related? Be careful with definitions and be precise.]  The size of the diode voltage drop depends on the materials used in diode construction. In diodes constructed using silicon-based semiconductors, V. If germanium-based semiconductors are used to construct the diode, V. For the purposes of this text, we will assume that diodes are silicon-based with V.  We can also be a bit more precise and realistic in our description of diode behavior. Instead of the behavior described in , we can instead relate the current through the diode in the forward direction to the voltage applied across the diode : where and are the voltages on the p-type and n-type semiconductor sides respectively, is the saturation current, is Boltzmann's constant, and is temperature. The value of is dependent on the materials used to construct the diode. For silicon, . The diode behavior is graphically represented in    More realistic diode behavior.     The saturation current is the current that can bleed through the diode even when reverse-biased. This current is typically very small and can be found in the specifications for a real diode. For the purposes of this text, I will often assume that A. I will also typically assume room temperature K.  Also discuss failure modes of diodes. Breakdown. Curve with fires.  "

LEDs are designed so that when the diode is forward biased, electrons and holes are pushed toward each other at the p-n junction. When an electron falls across the p-n junction from the conduction band to the lower-energy valence band (a process called recombination), the electron releases energy in the form of light. The color and intensity of this light depends on the materials used to construct the diode. LEDs are very energy-efficient, especially compared to incandescent light bulbs.  Photodiodes are a bit like LEDs operating in reverse. When light hits a photodiode surface, energy is depositied into atoms. This energy kicks an electron from the valence band in the p-type semiconductor into the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor.

Given this diode behavior, one can occasionally determine by inspection the conditions under which the diode is on or off.For example, let's analyze the circuit in .      In this circuit, which is plotted in .        With experience, the approach above may eventually be enough for you to solve some relatively simple diode circuits. When one is first learning to analyze diode circuits, or when analyzing more complicated circuits, the above method may not work. In such a case, one continues to use the cartoon diode behavior and guesses at whether each diode is off or on for a given instantaneous value of the input voltage. The remaining circuit elements are then analyzed under the assumption that the initial guesses are correct. In order to determine the veracity of the initial guesses, one looks for inconsistencies or impossibilities that arise from the rest of the circuit analysis. If an impossible situation occurs, then one knows that the initial assumptions were incorrect. In this scenario, one adjusts the initial guesses and re-analyzes the circuit, repeating until no inconsistencies occur. Stated differently, the steps to follow are:   Check the conditions in the circuit and see if it is possible to achieve a forward voltage drop across the diode. If it is completely impossible, then the diode will be off and you can treat it as a circuit break. If it is possible that the diode may be forward biased, then continue on to the next steps.    For each diode in your circuit, guess whether the diode is on or off. For each diode that is on, let the voltage drop be locked. For each diode that is off, treat the diode as a circuit break meaning no current can pass through it.    Analyze the rest of the circuit elements and search for inconsistencies.    If any results of your analysis conflict with your guesses about diodes that are on\/off, then go back and change your guesses until there are no inconsistencies.   Let's use this procedure for . If we assume that the diode is on when V, then V. But, this would require a current directed counterclockwise around the circuit which is not allowed by the diode. This inconsistency indicates that our assumption about the diode being on is incorrect in this case. If we change our assumption and instead state that the diode is off when V, then V since no current passes through the output resistor.   Diode example #2    Diode example #2.    Find the voltage in assuming V.       Let's examine this case-by-case.   Case 1: Both diodes are off. Then, so that as well. So, V. This is inconsistent with our assumption, since this results in a bias that is both large enough and in the correct direction to turn on diode . Thus, the assumptions in this case cannot be true.    Case 2: Both diodes are on. Then, V. Using Ohm's law, mA. Also, we'd see that due to the diode drop from point A to point B. Given this information, Ohm's law can again be applied to tell us that mA. The KCL is then used to determine that mA. There is no inconsistency here, meaning that we were correct in our assumptions and . Though it is unnecessary (there can be only one correct answer!), we will examine the remaining cases.    Case 3: Diode 2 is off while diode 3 is on. In this case, our circuit acts as a voltage divider, with V across the two resistors. So, which is more than enough to turn on diode two. Thus, this case cannot be valid.    Case 4: Diode 2 is on while diode 3 is off. In this case, V. This is identical to in case 2 meaning that diode 3 should activate. This conflicts with our assumption that diode 3 is off. Thus, this case cannot be valid.        Diode example #3    Diode example #3.    Find the voltage in assuming V. Note that this is identical to the previous problem except that the two resistors have been swapped.       Let's examine this case-by-case.   Case 1: Both diodes are off. Then, so that as well. So, V. This is inconsistent with our assumption, since this results in a bias that is both large enough and in the correct direction to turn on diode . Thus, the assumptions in this case cannot be true.    Case 2: Both diodes are on. Then, V. Using Ohm's law, mA. Also, we'd see that due to the diode drop from point A to point B. Given this information, Ohm's law can again be applied to tell us that mA. The KCL is then used to determine that mA. This is impossible since we've assumed ideal diodes which do not allow current to pass in the reverse direction.    Case 3: Diode 2 is off while diode 3 is on. In this case, our circuit acts as a voltage divider, with V across the two resistors. So, and which would not turn on . Thus, everything is consistent and this must be the valid scenario.    Case 4: Diode 2 is on while diode 3 is off. In this case, V. This is identical to in case 2 meaning that diode 3 should activate. This conflicts with our assumption that diode 3 is off. Thus, this case cannot be valid.         Python circuit treatment  Let's revisit the circuit in .

  "title": "Lab Safety",
  "body": " Lab Safety   The laboratory is a place to gain hands-on experience with course content, become proficient with standard lab tools, and to learn techniques in experimental design, analysis, and troubleshooting. It requires only a small amount of effort to protect you, your classmates, and the equipment from damage or injury. In this lab, the main hazards to protect against include electrical shock, fire, and burns.    General Precautions    Keep your work area organized and uncluttered.    Avoid tripping hazards by keeping cables off of the floor.    Turn off all power when making physical changes to circuit components.    Even after turning power off, use a wire to connect the two ends of each capacitor and inductor in your circuit before reaching into the circuit with your fingers. Capacitors and inductors can store energy, maintaining a voltage difference between their terminals even after the power to the circuit has been turned off.    Be wary of circuit components that have become hot. Check the temperature of components before solidly grabbing them.    If you smell smoke or something burning, turn off your circuit immediately . Only start troubleshooting once the circuit is off.    Practice reaching into your circuit with a single hand (rather than both simultaneously) to reduce the risk of current passing through the core of your body.    Never work with electronics if your hands, clothes, or equipment are wet.    Food and drink are allowed only in designated areas in the lab room. Ask your instructor where this designated area is. Food and drink are prohibited everywhere else in the lab room.    In case of emergency involving risk of life or an uncontrollable fire, call 911. Notify the instructor of any accident that involves injury or equipment damage.     The primary sources of electric power that you will encounter in the lab are the 120V AC wall\/table outlets and the DC power supplies (that may provide up to 30V DC) between their terminals. Higher voltages may be present inside lab equipment. Never stick any unauthorized objects\/fingers into outlets or inside equipment.  When working with electricity, the main danger to avoid is a situation where current passes through your body. While voltage can also be dangerous, it is only very high voltages (which should not be present in the lab) that could cause arcs and burns that are dangerous on their own. In the circumstances you'll encounter in the lab, voltage is only dangerous in that it can induce a current to pass through your body.  The danger posed by currents passing through your body depend on 1) the size of the current and 2) the path that the current follows through your body. The highest risk is associated with a current that passes through the core of your body (namely, your heart). This is why you should learn to use only one hand when reaching into a circuit to insert\/remove circuit components.  The danger posed by current passing through the heart changes based on the size of the current. Breathing can start becoming labored for currents as low as 20mA. By 75mA, breathing may cease until the current is removed. In the 100mA-200mA range, ventricular fibrillation of the heart occurs. This is a condition where the electrical signals that tell your heart to pump are disrupted, resulting in a quivering of the ventricles instead of pumping. This is the most dangerous situation as sudden cardiac death may occur. Above 200mA, a person's chances for survival are actually better. At 200mA or above, the heart actually clamps rather than going into ventricular fibrilation, and beating will often resume if the voltage is removed quickly.  In our lab, you are unlikely to encounter life-threatening situations as long as you do not disassemble lab equipment or stick items into the outlet. The resistance provided by your skin and internal body (hand-to-hand or hand-to-leg) is often as high as as long as your skin is dry. According to Ohm's Law, one would need somewhere on the order of 10kV to result in a 20mA current through the body assuming dry skin . If the skin is wet, however, the combined resistance of your skin and body could drop as low as , meaning that a voltage difference as low as 30V could result in 20mA passing through the body and could lead to difficulty breathing.  To complicate the above picture, the current at which heart fibrillation occurs is lowered for alternating current (AC) as compared to values for direct current (DC). A shock that causes a current of 30mA AC could cause heart fibrillation. Additionally, voltages higher than 400V can cause dielectric breakdown of the skin (which is the main contributor to the body's resistance), meaning the body's resistance could drop as low as a few hundred ohms and lower the voltage threshhold for fibrillation.  In most educational labs at this level of instruction, you're unlikely to face significant dangers to life, though there are still risks of light injury. As long as one keeps hands dry and avoids shocks from the outlet or equipment internals, the risk of injury is quite low. All the same, it is best to always be cognizant of potential danger and to take steps to miminize the risk of discomfort\/injury.  [CITATIONS NEEDED FOR ABOVE INFORMATION]  "

  "title": "Guide to Laboratory Notebooks",
  "body": " Guide to Laboratory Notebooks   In Physics 352, you will learn to keep a formal laboratory notebook. Rather than using a paper lab notebook, we are instead going to keep electronic notebooks. Electronic lab notebooks are seeing increasing use in research labs for several reasons:   It is easier to back-up an electronic document than it is for a physical document.    Data tables and graphs are almost always generated using computers. These objects are more easily incorporated into an electronic notebook (rather than taping physical sheets into a physical notebook).    Electronic lab notebooks can easily be shared amongst multiple people collaborating on the same project.    Lab instructors can grade notebooks without having to collect them from students. This allows students to continue work on other lab notebook entries during the grading process.     Good notebook skills will be essential to you as a practicing scientist, so it is important that you get in the habit of keeping good records early. The lab notebook is a diary of your activities each time you sit down to conduct an experiment. The following information is intended to help you practice good scientific record-keeping skills.    General Formatting and Info     Discuss with your instructor the site to be used for electronic lab notebooks. For example, an instructor may provide a lab notebook template through Google Docs. If using Google Docs, create in Google Drive a folder for your Electronics course. Place your lab notebook Google Doc in this folder.    Enter notes, data, etc. directly into your electronic lab notebook. You should NOT be writing things down on paper for entry at a later time.    Cross out any mistakes with a single line . Do not delete anything once youâ€™ve entered something into your notebook! This includes mistakes in the development of theory, mistakes in procedure, data entry, and analysis. You can learn from your mistakes, even minor ones, if you keep a record of them.    Do not refer to your lab manual in your notebook, except in the case where warnings or hardware specifications in the manual affect your procedure. In real life, you will not have a lab manual, but you will often have technical manuals for the equipment.    You may insert images directly into your lab notebook. You can also directly paste data or code into your notebook, though I'd suggest also inserting a hyperlink to the original files. In order to do this, place the file that you'd like to link to in the same Google Drive folder as your Lab Notebook document. Then, in your Google Doc, choose Insert -> Link. Search for and select the desired file.    I will not be grading explicitly on grammar\/spelling\/etc. That said, your notebook needs to be clear enough that someone else (me in this case) can read your notebook and understand what you are doing or the point you are trying to make with a statement.       Sections of Your Lab Notebook  I would recommend creating a new subfolder for each experiment in the â€˜Labsâ€™ folder of your electronic lab notebook. Inside a labâ€™s subfolder, you can include further subfolders or pages as you see fit. Your notebook entry for each lab should be divided into several sections which are described below. If the lab has multiple sub-experiments, group all sections for a single sub-experiment together and keep it separate from other sub-experiment details.    PREFACE â€“ In this section, provide a brief introductory paragraph (20-40 words or so) describing the theme and goals of the experiment.    THEORY â€“ Provide a circuit sketch (with components labeled with variables rather than specific values) for the circuit type that you intend to study in this lab activity. This will typically accompany either theoretical derivations or a report of theoretical results that you intend to investigate experimentally.    APPARATUS â€“ In this section, you should include details about the equipment and circuits you are working with. This should include:   A list of instruments used, including make and model.    Pin designations (showing the layout of integrated circuit chips, for instance) or other important information regarding parts    A schematic diagram, including   Components labeled with values or part numbers (e.g. 1N914 diode or 2-kâ„¦ resistor)    Clearly-labeled input\/output terminals    Major connections to external power supplies, etc.          PROCEDURE â€“ Use two to three sentences to explain 1) what was measured, 2) what was varied, and 3) how you intend to compare experimental results to theory. Typically, you do not need to include each and every little step along the way of accomplishing this task, but if there is information that you think is critical to remember (odd steps you needed to take), issues that arose, or changes that were made, these details would be included in this section, after your initial procedure summary.  If you obtain unexpected results, try and find out why. Record any debugging you do. Leave wrong results or mistakes in your lab book, crossed out with a single line.  Note: In other lab courses, this section may need to expand with more detail than what Iâ€™m asking for above. In electronics, the equipment setup and use is pretty standard from experiment to experiment. As a result, detailed notes regarding circuit construction on the prototyping board (for instance) is not necessary in this course, but similar types of information may be critical to record in other courses.    RAW DATA TABLES â€“ Data should be entered directly into your lab notebook. LabArchives allows you to create a Microsoft Office file (such as a Word or Excel document) within one of its pages, so you should not be recording data into external programs. That said, this data can be copied into another program for analysis purposes (e.g. into LoggerPro).    RESULTS â€“ In this section, you should include tables or graphs that display your experimental results. Your experimental data should be represented using symbols when you are graphing. Axes should be labeled and should include units. If possible, produce a theoretical curve as well for direct comparison to your experimental results. Depending on the lab activity, there may be other methods of reporting your results.    DISCUSSION - Write one paragraph, at least, in conclusion, whether you needed to do any analysis or not. Did you see evidence for the effect you set out to observe? What was the value, with units and uncertainties, of the quantity you set out to measure? If your results did not agree with your expectations, as is sometimes the case, speculate on possible reasons. This should be similar to the Conclusions section of a formal lab report.    APPENDIX - Here, you can include longer spreadsheets of data as well as printouts of the code used for data analysis. When including code, include both a printout but also attach a .py file containing the executable code that you used along with any ancillary files that the code calls (e.g. data files).     "

  "body": " Prototyping Board (or Breadboard)  Prototyping boards are rows of connectors wired together behind a plastic face. While circuits in your electronics are soldered (often on printed circuitboards), prototyping boards have holes that allow component\/wire leads to be pushed in to form a solderless connection. This makes circuit assembly, disassembly, and modification much easier and faster while developing a circuit. Once a final circuit design has been determined, a more permanent construction may be performed.  The prototyping boards that we'll use look like this:  (for accessibility)  Along the top of this Proto-Board, we have four rows of connectors. The holes in the top row are all connected to +5V, the holes in the second row are connected to +V (variable between +1.3V to +15V), the holes in the third row are connected to â€“V (variable between -1.3V to -15V), and the holes in the fourth row are connected to the boardâ€™s ground. These connections are hard-wired and cannot be changed.  (for accessibility)    The rest of the board is broken up into segments that look like the figure to the right. The connections are set up such that:     The holes that are grouped into a single long vertical column are connected to each other, but with a break halfway down each column. For instance, all holes covered by the purple line are connected internally,as are holes covered by the green line and orange line, though holes covered by different colors are not connected internally. One use for these columns is to distribute voltages from the top voltage strip to other parts of the circuit.    There are also a series of horizontal groupings containing five holes in a row. These five holes (for instance, the holes covered by the blue line) are connected to each other internally. Likewise, the same is true for the holes covered by the brick red line and by the lavender line and gray line. Again, holes covered by different colored lines are not connected internally.    Using these various rows and columns, we are able to make connections between electrical components (such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, semiconductor chips, and wires). While it takes a little practice to get used to this design, you will quickly find that these boards allow great flexibility as you prototype your circuits.      "

  "body": " Oscilloscopes (BK Precision 2190E or 2542B)    (for accessibility)    (for accessibility)    The oscilloscope is an extremely versatile instrument. It can be used to measure both steady and time-dependent voltages, frequency, time duration, phase difference, and harmonic distortion. Some oscilloscopes automatically test transistors, perform spectral analysis, integrate, differentiate, sum, subtract, filter, and store electrical signals. Anyone working in an experimental science should be able to use an oscilloscope with considerable confidence.  The oscilloscopes that we are using in lab (BK Precision 2542B or 2190E) are general-purpose, two-channel digital storage instruments capable of displaying and capturing electrical signals with frequencies up to 100 MHz. Its front panel can be divided into a number of sections:   The color LCD display shows the signal on one or more of the two input channels, using a different color for each channel.    A set of buttons along the right hand side of the display are used to make menu item selections.    A set of buttons and knobs on the right half of the instrument control some of the advanced oscilloscope functions, including:   a TRIGGER section that permits one to control the starting point for the displayed waveform,    a VERTICAL section, accepting up to two input signals and containing controls to vary the voltage resolution (among other things),    a HORIZONTAL or â€˜time baseâ€™ section that controls the time resolution of the display.        In its most commonly used mode of operation, an oscilloscope creates a visual display by capturing and successively overlaying identical windows of time, each window beginning at the same point (relative to the â€˜trigger pointâ€™) on the signal. The time base of the scope determines how much time is represented by each horizontal division of the LCD display. The triggering function determines when each time window is to begin; proper triggering is necessary for stable, unambiguous display of the desired waveform. Finally, the vertical section of the scope controls the amplitude of the information displayed. It determines for each of the two channels how many volts are represented by each vertical division on the display.   Hints regarding oscilloscope controls    To change the horizontal (time base) scale:   The Time\/div knob changes the time per division (sec\/div are color coded by input channel and displayed on the screen).    Position knob changes location of the trigger (labeled as an arrow along the top of the screen).

Autoset: scope tries to choose overall best scope settings (sometimes useful when you canâ€™t see anything, but generally used as a last resort because it can also mislead you.       Measure menu:   You can select various measurements and which channel to measure. Be very careful with automatic measurements (again these can be deceptive). Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements. Note that the automatic mode searches for the very top and bottom of the signals (when measuring voltages) which may not provide an accurate value for the actual amplitude as noise on the signal may artificially inflate the max\/min values.       Cursor menu:   Choose time (vertical bars) or voltage (horizontal bars) measurement.    Choose which channel to measure (measurement cursors may be the same color as the channel they are measuring).    Choose manual adjustment (adjust each cursor separately) or fixed (adjust both cursors simultaneously).    Choose which cursor to adjust (Cursor A\/Cursor B).    Use the knob in the upper-left corner of the controls to adjust the cursor positions.    The position relative to ground (or trigger zero time for time measurements) is displayed on the screen with the â€˜@â€™ symbol.    The relative distance between the cursors is displayed on the screen with the â€˜ â€™ symbol.

  "body": " Lab: Voltage Divider   Objective: Through the course of this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the operation of a prototyping board and its various components (breadboard, voltage sources, potentiometers, and switches) and with resistor color codes. You will build a DC voltage divider circuit using this prototyping board and will use a handheld digital multimeter (DMM) to measure properties of circuit behavior.   Equipment: Prototyping board, digital multimeter (DMM), resistors with varied values, wires.   THEORY  Using content from class, derive an expression for the ratio for the voltage divider circuit in .          INTRODUCTION TO EQUIPMENT  For the following steps, explain in your lab notebook the behavior of the various components that you test.    With the prototyping board turned off, use the DMM in resistance mode to verify the internal connections of the breadboard. In other words, verify that the resistance between holes is if they are supposed to be connected and 0.L (essentially, out of range) if the holes are not supposed to be connected.    With the prototyping board still turned off, set up the DMM to verify the +5V row (with respect to the boardâ€™s ground). Once the DMM is physically connected and set to voltage mode, only then turn the prototyping board on and verify the expected voltage behavior. Specifically, confirm that the 5V row is indeed 5V above the board common.    Turn the prototyping board off, change the DMM connections, and verify the other power strips. ALWAYS TURN OFF THE POWER WHEN CHANGING CONNECTIONS!    Use the DMM to verify the behavior of both on-board potentiometers. Do behaviors deviate from expected behaviors in any way? Describe how the available terminals correspond to parts of the potentiometersâ€™ designs.    Use the DMM to verify the SPDT switch behavior.    Youâ€™ve been given five different resistors. Use the color codes to determine their specified resistance values, and then verify these values using your DMM. Provide all of these predictions, results, and corrections in your notebook. Remember, this isn't about getting things right immediately. The lab notebook is a journal of your activities. Record your mistakes, corrections, and notes about what you learned.     Discuss your findings with your professor prior to moving on to the next section.     EXPERIMENT  In this section, you will construct the DC voltage divider pictured below using the prototyping board, one fixed resistor, the on-board potentiometer, and a SPDT switch.          With the prototyping board turned off, construct your circuit, remembering the following:   Make use of the long columns of holes to distribute voltages to convenient locations on your board.    Remember the internal wiring of the prototyping boards. Donâ€™t accidentally â€˜shortâ€™ your resistor or potentiometer.    Donâ€™t use long wires when short wires will do. Try to keep your circuit organized and use efficient placement of wires. A neat and organized circuit is much easier to troubleshoot!    Verify your circuit and discuss the next steps with your professor before moving on.     You must measure the ratio as a function of the variable resistance . Use the DMM to first measure the actual value (with the prototyping board turned on). Then, with the prototyping board off again, move the DMM connections to measure the variable resistance. Please note the following:   When measuring the resistance of the variable resistor, ensure that the multimeter dial is correctly set and that the SPDT is in the position that creates a break in the circuit.    When measuring , ensure that the multimeter dial is correctly set and that the SPDT is in the position that creates a closed connection in this segment of the circuit.    You will need to repeat the previous two steps, measuring potentiometer resistance and for each of ten potentiometer resistance values. Ensure that your ten potentiometer resistances are chosen to provide adequate coverage of the full potentiometer range.    Record your results in a spreadsheet table and ensure this table is included in your lab notebook.       Use Python to graph the results of your measurements ( vs ). Use symbols (not a line) to represent your data points. On the same axes, generate a theoretical plot based on the predicted behavior of this circuit and represent this theory curve using a solid line plot. Also provide a legend.   Question: Are there any deviations from expected behavior at low or high resistances? If so, discuss this in your lab notebook.    Extension: In your lab notebook, discuss how you can make a voltage divider and conduct this experiment using only a single potentiometer (without the fixed resistor that we used in our circuit). Include a circuit diagram. Also discuss common places in your everyday life where you may find this type of circuit used.    Ensure that all required parts are included in your lab notebook. See for details.     "

  "title": "Lab: Oscilloscope Primer",
  "body": " Lab: Oscilloscope Primer   Objective: Through the course of this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the operation of a the BK Precision 2190E Digital Oscilloscope. You will use the scope to measure an AC voltage signal from the internal function generator of the scope, and from an external function generator. Our goal will be to understand how to display a signal on the scope, measure frequency and amplitude values, and trigger the scope properly by adjusting the triggering threshold and other trigger settings.   Equipment: Function generator, oscilloscope, BNC coaxial cables.   Lab Notebook: In your theory section of the report, you should discuss any functions of the oscilloscope that we use today and their purpose. In the data section, you should include the signal data and photos asked for throughout the lab. You do not need a procedure, results or conclusion section for this lab. Otherwise, please follow the lab notebook guidelines provided in .   THE OSCILLOSCOPE INTERFACE  The oscilloscope interface seems quite complicated at first, but in order to measure one signal vs. time we will only need a few functions.   Turn on your scope using the power button on the top of the case. Wait for it to start and then hit the Default Setup button- it is blue in the upper right of the front face. You should see the following display:   (for accessibility)     The scope has the ability to display two signals at once. Turn on the channel two display by hitting the 2 button. A pink line, representing the voltage plugged into the channel 2 BNC input connector, should now appear on top of Channel 1's yellow line. (Both voltages are zero at the moment as nothing is plugged into either channel.)    You can use the small knobs below the 1 and 2 buttons to displace the signal lines on the display. Try it and see if you can move channel 1 upwards and channel two downwards as shown below:   (for accessibility)     Turn off channel 2 by hitting the 2 button. Re-center signal 1 on the x-axis. Turn off the channel 2 menu that appeared on the right of the screen by hitting the Menu On\/Off button.   To explore more of the functions of the scope we will need to look at a signal.    MEASURING THE BUILT-IN TEST SIGNAL  The oscilloscope has a built in test signal. It is a 1KHz square wave, and can be measured by connecting an oscilloscope probe to the two metal clips in the lower right of the front face.  (for accessibility)     Find your oscilloscope probe. Plug it into the Channel 1 BNC connector on the oscilloscope. Set the attenuation switch on the probe to 1X. (10X means the voltage measured in attenuated by 10- useful for high voltage projects.)    The probe has two clips. The side alligator clip must be connected to ground. The center hook clip is connected to the point in a circuit where you want to measure the voltage. Find the metal leads for the test signal (shown above in the figure). Connect the probe clips to the leads. One lead should be clearly labeled as ground. Channel 1 should display the test signal as shown below:  (for accessibility)      Take a picture of your channel 1 display for your lab notebook.    You should see the oscilloscope's vertical and horizontal scales on the display screen. The CH1 = 1.00V marker means that the vertical grid spacing (between horizontal dotted lines) represents a change of 1.00 V. The M = 500 Î¼s marker means there is a 500 Î¼s spacing between each vertical dotted line. What is the amplitude of this square wave? Include this value in your report.     Try to change the vertical and horizontal scale by using the large CH 1 knobs on the front panel. Change the horizontal scale to display the wave on a 100 Î¼s timescale and a 2V vertical scale. Take a picture of the output to include in your report.     Return the waveform to its default view. You can do this either by reversing your changes made above or, even easier, by just hitting the Default Setup button again.       MEASURING A SINE WAVE  Now we will use an external function generator to produce an AC sine wave signal for us to measure.   With the function generator turned off, use a BNC cable to connect the function generator output to the oscilloscope Channel 2 input.    Turn on the function generator. We want a 1V amplitude 1kHz sine wave signal to measure. Press the Amp menu button and type in 1.0 and then press V. Then, click Freq and type 1.0 and click the kHz button. At this point, there is still no signal being produced. Press the Output button to start producing the desired signal. The Output button should now be glowing, indicating that the function generator output is active.    The display should show a sine wave, but probably too zoomed in to see the whole wave. Hit the Auto button to autoscale the display to the signal. The following image shows the correctly auto-scaled sine wave. Click the Measure button on the oscilloscope and select parameters that you might want to measure for each channel, including the Peak-to-Peak Amplitude and frequency of the signal. What are the values of these parameters? Record values in your notebook along with an image of the oscilloscope display.   (for accessibility)      To make sure you understand the different settings of the function generator and scope, do the following:   Set the function generator to display a 500Hz signal with a 20V pk-pk amplitude    Display the signal on the scope with a 10V vertical scale and a 1ms timescale.    Take a picture of this output and include with your report.       Note that you can use the position knob to move the signal up and down on the screen. This is purely moving the 0V reference position on the screen. The position of this reference point is indicated by the yellow arrow with a 1 in it.    Also note that you can adjust the vertical Zoom , or scaling for each channel independently. As you adjust the CH1 knob, you can see that the value CH1=___V changes in the bottom left corner. This number indicates the change in voltage vertically across one of the small boxes in the grid displayed on screen for the Channel 1 signal. You can also adjust the horizontal scaling in the same way, with the M___ms number providing the change in time horizontally across one of the small boxes in your grid. You will often need to adjust these appropriately to see your desired signal. Note: You should always try to maximize the vertical size of each signal that you are trying to measure to get the most precise measurements using the built-in measure feature and using the cursors (explained below). If you have a periodic signal, it is often desirable to have 3-5 periods displayed in order to use the built-in measure feature.       USING THE CURSORS  With complicated signals, the auto measured output for amplitude and frequency cannot necessarily be trusted. In these cases, itâ€™s better to do manual measurements with the oscilloscope's cursor functionality.   Set up the function generator to produce a 1kHz, 20V pk-pk sine wave.    Display this signal on the scope, auto-scaled. Hit the Run\/Stop button to freeze the signal for better analysis. The button should light up red when data acquisition is stopped. (Donâ€™t forget itâ€™s stopped and that youâ€™re no longer measuring real time data!)    To manually measure the period of the wave, we will use vertical cursors. Hit the Cursors button on the top center of the scope control panel. In the menu that appears, change the mode to Manual . Then change the type to Time and ensure that the source is CH1 . You should see two dotted lines appear on the display.    You can move the position of the lines by selecting cursor A or B in the screen menu and then turning the small knob in the upper left of the control panel. Try to move cursor A onto a peak of the wave. Do the same for cursor B.   NOTE: If you can only see one cursor line on the screen, it might be that the other is off the edge of the display. Try selecting the invisible cursor and moving the knob until it appears in view. Sometimes you might need to zoom out in time or voltage to find the cursors.     The cursors appear with readouts that tell you the time location for each individual cursor (with respect to the trigger, which will be discussed next), the time interval between the two cursors, and the associated frequency. Do these values make sense? Record these values and take a photo of the screen for your report.     Switch the cursor type to Voltage to get horizontal cursors. Place them so that you can measure the pk-pk voltage amplitude. Record the pk-pk voltage, and take a photo for your report.        Triggering  The oscilloscope needs to know where the wave starts in order to display a nice, steady display output. This process of finding the start of the waveform is called triggering . The trigger determines the location of your signal with respect to the scopeâ€™s definition of t=0s. The blue T in the image below indicates the time location of the trigger.  (for accessibility)  Using the trigger menu and cursor wheel, we can set the trigger level at whatever voltage threshold we want. When the experimental signal crosses the trigger level that we set, the oscilloscope calls that time t=0s and all other times are measured with respect to that time. The oscilloscope can be told to trigger off of CH1, CH2, or even other external signals. It can also be told to trigger when the signal rises through the trigger level or falls through the trigger level.  For a simple AC sine wave, triggering is pretty easy to set up with the Auto-scale feature, but for other signals you may need to manually adjust the trigger settings.   Make sure the scope is in RUN mode, not STOP mode.    With the AC sine signal displayed, find the Trig Menu button on the control panel (on the right, under Auto). Hit this button to bring up the trigger settings menu.    In this menu, we say how we want the scope to find the beginning of the signal. By default, Type is set to Edge , Source is set to CH1 , and Slope is set to Up . This means we are telling the scope to search for an edge with a rising slope on channel 1, and place everything such that that edge is at t=0s.    Try to set the slope type to Down . Discuss in your report how the display changes.    We also need to tell the scope how big of a voltage actually counts as a signal. This is especially important if we have a noisy experiment. We donâ€™t want to accidentally trigger on noise instead of our real signal. This function is controlled by the Trigger Level (or just Level ) knob on the control panel (lower right).    Try adjusting the trigger level and you should see the level line appear on the display. Any voltage signal with a peak below this line will not be considered a signal. Try moving the level to above the sine wave peak. Describe what happens in your report.    Adjust the level knob to manually regain good triggering. As a rule of thumb, it is good to have the trigger level around 30% below the peak of your signal.     The location of the triggerâ€™s t=0s can be adjusted left or right on the screen using the Horizontal Position knob. A word of advice: if the trigger time is offset from the middle of the screen and you change the time resolution on the scope, the trigger indicator may be outside of the window of view on the display. This can sometimes cause confusion if you do not realize that you are looking at a portion of the signal well after (or before) the trigger time.   In more advanced contexts one can trigger all oscilloscope channels off of Channel 1, Channel 2, or off of a third external trigger. We will discuss these options later on in the course, as needed.

  "body": " Lab: RC High-Pass Filter   Objective: To use the oscilloscope to explore the attenuation, phase-shifting, and transient behavior of an RC high pass filter circuit. This experiment involves resistance, capacitance, filtering, attenuation, half-power frequencies, time constants, phase shifts, and oscilloscope and function generator operation.   Equipment: Proto-board, digital oscilloscope, function generator, resistor, capacitor.   RC HIGH-PASS FILTER THEORY  The aim of this experiment is to test the reliability of the theoretical predictions for a RC high pass filter circuit like the one shown in .  RC high-pass filter circuit. Use and .   The prediction for the ratio of the amplitudes of the output voltage to the input voltage is . The half-power angular frequency, , is given by . The theoretical prediction for the phase shift between output and input voltages is .    RC CIRCUIT EXPERIMENTS    Begin by constructing the high pass filter circuit shown in Fig. 1 on your prototyping board. Make sure your prototyping board is turned off!     Connect the built-in function generator and ground across the circuit input. Also connect this input to the CH1 input on the oscilloscope. Connect the circuit output to the CH2 input on the scope. Have your professor check your circuit before turning the prototyping board on.     Set your input sine wave to have a peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 2.0 volts.    Trigger on CH1 (AUTO, Rising Slope). Use oscilloscope probes to make connections between the oscilloscope and the circuit. Make sure both probes are set to x1 attenuation. You can display both channels simultaneously on the oscilloscope display.    Proceed to acquire input-output data that lets you test the theoretical predictions given by the two equations above. Your amplitude data should consist of pairs of voltage values , as well as phase shifts acquired at 30-40 frequencies (e.g. 100 Hz, 200 Hz, â€¦, 900 Hz, 1 kHz, 1.5 kHz, 2 kHz, , 9.5 kHz, 10 kHz, 20 kHz, 30 kHz, 40 kHz). In addition to these frequency values, also try to get one measurement at the predicted resonance frequency . To measure the phase shift, we recommend zooming in on the zero-crossings and measuring the time delay between the signals on the two channels (using the cursor function on the oscilloscope). From the frequency (or period) and the time delay, you can calculate the phase shift (in radians or degrees).   Tip 1: You are allowed to use the Measure functionality to measure , and the phase between channels 1 and 2. Given that this functionality can sometimes provide poor results, you should manually check your measurements occasionally using the cursors (for instance, manually check at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz).   Tip 2: When advancing to a new frequency, find the frequency you want, wait for the signal to stabilize, and then press RUN\/STOP to temporarily freeze the oscilloscope. This allows you to have a stable display while you are writing down your results or using your cursors to find experimental values. When complete, press RUN\/STOP again to unfreeze the oscilloscope.   Q: Explain how you determined the phase shift manually from experimental measurements using cursors.   Q: How could you use the experimental time delay seen on the scope to search for the half-power frequency if you werenâ€™t certain of the values of or ?    Plot vs using symbols. Decide whether to plot your data using linear axes or a semi-log plot (with a logarithmic frequency axis). Also plot a theoretical curve using the equations from the introduction.   Q: How did you decide whether to use linear or semi-log plot axes? Think about the information you are trying to present and which option best highlights the behavior.    Plot phase shift vs frequency using the same type of axes that you used in step 4. Proceed to perform a curve fit to your experimental data (based on the theoretical phase equation) with as a fit parameter. (See for guidance.) Report this value.   Q: How does your fitted value of compare to the theoretically-predicted value? How does it compare to the value you found in step 5?    Plot phase vs frequency. As you did before, plot experimental data using symbols. On the same axes, generate a plot using your curve fit parameters, plotting this fit curve as a line.     "

  "body": " Newton's Method   FINDING THE ROOT OF ONE NONLINEAR EQUATION   Newton's method is a computational algorithm that can be used to find the roots of an equation. Let's illustrate with an example.      In , the solid blue line represents the function . Assume that is an unknown root of such that . We may be able to guess at an approximate value of the root , but this is unlikely to be very precise. Exmining , we can see that we can find a better approximation of the function's root by using a straight-line (dashed red curve) with the same slope as our function at the location of our initial guess, which can be rearranged to find our new estimate We'll call this new approximated root . It's very possible that this new guess still lacks the precision that we desire, so we can repeat the process again, iterating as many times as we desire using until is less than some user-defined tolerance that defines the desired precision, as the change in the estimate to our root from one iteration to the next should become smaller as our estimate approaches the real value of the function's root. Note that this method requires knowledge of the functional form of our function as well as knowledge of or the ability to calculate the analytic form of .  We can be a little more rigorous with the theory underlying Newton's method. Let's assume that we have a function that has a root such that . We can expand our function as a Taylor series around some initial guess for the root, , giving us . Evaluating this expansion at the root gives us . If we divide both sides by and assume that all terms that are order two or higher in are small, then or where is our estimate of the root based on one iteration of this method. Now, the closer is to the real root , the better our estimate will be. So, once we have , we can use this as our new guess for another iteration, giving us a result identical to what we found above, , which we iterate until is less than some user-defined tolerance that defines the desired precision.  A word of caution: Newton's method is not foolproof and it can fail sometimes. Please take a look at other computational methods textbooks or webpages to investigate these failure modes. For the purposes of this text, try several different initial guesses if your first choice leads to a failure of the method.    FINDING THE ROOTS OF A SYSTEM OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS   Write your equations in the following form: with roots . The Taylor expansion for can be written as so that . Each value can represent the -th equation in a system of equations. This system can be written in vector form as where is the matrix with elements . Since is a root of the equations, we have so that where . Thus, we can get a good estimate of our root, , using where now. This is a set of ordinary linear simultaneous equations of the form which can be solved using the linalg.solve package in NumPy. Once we've solved for , our new estimate of the root is .
