If a file can't be found in LaTeX, use a command like
    tlmgr install tabularray.sty 
in the terminal.

I've run into issues with tabularray.sty and ninecolors.sty. I've modified the installLatex.sh file to include these files in the install, but they weren't there initially. I think I might need to re-install each time I start a new codespace? Not certain.
