            The prediction for the ratio of the amplitudes of the output voltage to the input voltage is
            <me>
                G_V = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(f_0/f\right)^2}}
            </me>.
            The half-power frequency is given by <m>f_0=1/2πRC</m>. The theoretical prediction for the phase shift between output and input voltages is
            <me>
                \phi=\phi_\text{out}-\phi_\text{in}=\tan^{-1}\left(f_0/f\right)
            </me>.

                    Proceed to acquire data that lets you test the theoretical predictions given by the two equations above. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your data should consist of pairs of voltage values <m>(V_\text{in}</m>,<m>V_\text{out})</m> as well as phase shifts acquired at 24 frequencies (100 Hz, 200 Hz, …, 900 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, <m>\dots</m> , 9 kHz, 10 kHz, 20 kHz, <m>\dots</m> 50 kHz). Don't forget to record your frequencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <alert>Tip:</alert> You are allowed to use the <sq>Measure</sq> functionality to measure <m>V_\text{in},\ V_\text{out},\ f_\text{CH1}</m>, and the phase <m>\phi</m> between channels 1 and 2. Given that this functionality can sometimes provide poor results, you should manually check your measurements occasionally using the cursors (for instance, manually check at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <alert>Tip:</alert> To measure the phase shift, we recommend <sq>zooming</sq> in on the zero-crossings and measuring the time delay between the signals on the two channels (using the cursor function on the oscilloscope). From the frequency (or period) and the time delay, you can calculate the phase shift (in radians or degrees).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <alert>Tip:</alert> When advancing to a new frequency, find the frequency you want and wait for the signal to stabilize before recording values. If conducting a manual measurement of parameters using cursors, you may want to press RUN/STOP to temporarily freeze the oscilloscope. This allows you to have a stable display while you are writing down your results or using your cursors to find experimental values. When complete, press RUN/STOP again to unfreeze the oscilloscope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <alert>Q:</alert> Explain how you determined the phase shift manually from experimental measurements using cursors. Provide an example of your work in your lab notebook, including a picture of your oscilloscope display.

                    Experimentally determine the value of <m>f_0</m> (to the nearest Hz) and proceed to record values for <m>\left(V_\text{out}, V_\text{in}, \phi\right)</m> at <m>f=f_0</m>. Include this data point as part of the data set that you recorded earlier.
