    <title>Propagating Uncertainties Through Curve Fits</title>

    <p>
        When conducting experiments, any data collected will have some uncertainty associated with it. These uncertainties will naturally give rise to uncertainties in any subsequent curve fitting results. Here, we will explain the Monte Carlo technique for estimating uncertainties for fit parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Monte Carlo technique uses repeated curve fits on synthetic data to generate a distribution of values for each fit parameter. Fit parameter uncertainties can be found from these distributions. The synthetic data that is used in these repeated curve fits are generated using the original data with their associated uncertainties.
