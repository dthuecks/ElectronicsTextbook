    <title>Kirchhoff's Laws</title>
  
    <p> 
        There are three laws that will make up the foundation of our DC circuit analysis. In truth, these laws will extend 
        beyond the DC circuit analysis presented in this chapter, but we will leave discussion of these extensions to future 
        chapters.

        Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), or Junction Law, relies on conservation of charge to say that the rate at which charges 
        enter a junction must be equivalent to the rate at which charges leave the junction
<me>\sum I_\text{in}=\sum I_\text{out}.</me>
for a scenario as pictured in <xref ref="dc-kcl" />. The KCL can also be represented mathematically as
<me>\sum\limits_i I_i = 0</me>
where <m>I_i\lt 0</m> for currents leaving a node and <m>I_i\gt 0</m> for currents entering a node.</p>

    Another conservation law, the conservation of energy, is ultimately responsible for what we call Kirchhoff's Voltage Law 
    (KVL), or the Loop Law. If one walks around any loop in a circuit (such as that shown in <xref ref="dc-kvl" />), the sum of 
    the voltage changes as one moves in a single direction around a complete loop must add up to zero, or
    <me>\sum\limits_i \Delta V_i=0\text{ around a closed loop.}</me> 
    When using the KVL equation, voltages rise as one crosses a voltage source from the negative terminal to positive terminal 
    and voltages fall in the opposite direction. Additionally, voltages fall across a resistor in the direction of current and 
    rise in the opposite direction.

    The last rule we'll introduce here is Ohm's Law. For the situation shown in Figure~\ref{DC-ohm}, the magnitude of the 
    voltage change across a resistor is dependent on the resistance and the magnitude of current in the resistor according to
<me>\Delta V=IR</me>
where <m>\Delta V=V_A - V_B</m>.
A note on signs: When using Ohm's law, <m>\Delta V</m> and <m>I</m> actually represent <m>\left|\Delta V\right|</m> 
and <m>\left| I \right|</m>. It is conventional to use Ohm's law to relate magnitudes of <m>\Delta V</m> to <m>I</m>. The 
signs on each variable are linked by the fact that current is directed from high to low voltage. So, if current is in the 
direction indicated in <xref ref="dc-ohm" />, then <m>V_A \gt V_B</m>.
