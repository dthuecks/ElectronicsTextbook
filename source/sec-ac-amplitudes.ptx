    <title>Characterizing Signal Size</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            With AC signals, there are multiple ways to represent amplitude. Here, we will examine methods of characterizing voltage amplitudes, but all methods discussed apply equally well to any other sinusoidally-varying quantity.

                        Peak-to-Peak voltage <m>V_{p-p}</m> is the voltage difference <m>V_\text{max}-V_\text{min}</m>.

                    <p>
                        Peak voltage (or amplitude) <m>V_\text{peak}=A=V_{p-p}/2</m>.

                    <p>
                        Root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude is calculated by examining a single cycle of data <m>\left(V(t_i)\right)</m> where <m>t_i</m> are the values of time for which <m>n</m> measurements were recorded. Then,  
                        <me>
                            V_\text{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} V_i^2}{n}}
                        </me>
                        which is <m>V_\text{peak}/\sqrt{2}</m> for sinusoidal waves.

                        The average power <m>P_\text{avg}</m> dissipated in a resistor <m>R</m> due to a sinusoidal signal is
                        <me>
                            P_\text{avg}=I_\text{rms}^2 R = \frac{V_\text{rms}^2}{R}
                        </me>.

                        Power in a signal <m>P_2</m> relative to the power in some other signal <m>P_1</m> can be represented using a logarithmic scale called decibels, where

                            <mrow> \amp = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right) </mrow>
