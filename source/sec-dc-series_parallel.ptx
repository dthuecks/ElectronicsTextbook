        Let's begin by applying Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law to the circuit shown in <xref ref="dc-circuit1" />.

                \draw[->, blue] ([xshift= 1.5cm, yshift=-1.5cm ] a) arc(140:-140:1cm) node[midway, left, xshift=-4mm] {Loop I};

        </figure>
        
        At node A, we apply the KCL to find
        <men xml:id="eqn-intro-kcl1">
            \sum\limits_i I_i=0 \Rightarrow I_1 - I_2 - I_3 = 0. 
        </men>

        The KVL can then be applied to Loop I and Loop II. Starting with Loop I, we will start in the lower left corner and 
        traverse Loop I in the direction indicated by the arrow. Traversing this loop has us pass through battery <m>V_b</m> 
        from the negative to positive terminal, resulting in <m>\Delta V=+V_b</m>. The next component that we encounter is 
        <m>R_1</m>, which we travel across in the direction of current, so <m>\Delta V=-I_2 R_1</m> by Ohm's Law. Likewise, 
        <m>\Delta V=-I_2 R_2</m> as we travel across <m>R_2</m> on the way back to our starting point. The KVL for Loop 1 will 
        thus give
        <men xml:id="eqn-intro-kvl1">
            \sum\limits_{i\text{ in Loop I}} \left(\Delta V\right)_i = 0 \Rightarrow V_b - I_2 R_1 - I_2 R_2 = 0.
        </men>

        A similar application of the KVL to Loop II gives
        <men xml:id="eqn-intro-kvl2">
            \sum\limits_{i\text{ in Loop II}} \left(\Delta V\right)_i = 0 \Rightarrow V_b - I_3 R_3 = 0.
        </men>
        
        Often, voltages provided by batteries (or a DC voltage source) and the resistances are known as these were the 
        physical components assembled into the circuit. Thus, Equations~<xref ref="eqn-intro-kcl1" /> 
        - <xref ref="eqn-intro-kvl2" /> represent a series of equations that must be solved to determine currents 
        <m>I_1,\ I_2, \text{ and } I_3</m> in <xref ref="dc-circuit1" />.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rather than solving this system of equations for the three currents, we will instead perform some intermediate 
        analysis to investigate the behavior of resistor combinations. Starting with Equation~\ref{intro-kvl1}, we can 
        see that
        <me>
            V_b - I_2\left(R_1 + R_2\right) = V_b - I_2 R_{1+2}
        </me>.
        Resistors <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> are considered to be in <term>series</term>. Resistors are in series if the 
        current in one resistor must be the same current in the other series resistors. In this case, <m>R_1</m> and 
        <m>R_2</m> are in series because <m>I_2</m> must be the current in each of the resistors since there is no 
        junction between them. We see that the voltage drop across the pair of series resistors is just <m>I_2 R_{1+2}</m> 
        where <m>R_{1+2}=R_1 + R_2</m>, meaning that resistors in series act together as a single resistor that has a 
        resistance equaling the sum of the series resistances. This relationship holds for any number of resistors that 
        are in series such that
        <men xml:id="eqn-intro-series-resistors">
            R_\text{eq} = \sum\limits_\text{series} R_i \quad \text{(Resistors in series)}
        </men>.
        This means that currents <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>, and <m>I_3</m> will have identical values in all three circuits 
        displayed in Figure~\ref{dc-circuit1-alt1}

        If we now examine the simplified circuit in <xref ref="dc-circuit1-alt1" />b, we can see that both <m>R_{1+2}</m>
        and <m>R_3</m> both have the same voltage drop across them

            <mrow> I_2 \amp = \frac{V_b}{R_{1+2}} </mrow>
            <mrow> I_3 \amp = \frac{V_b}{R_3} </mrow>
        </md>.
        These expressions can be inserted into Equation~<xref ref="eqn-intro-kcl1"/> to find

        <me>
            V_b = I_1 \left(\frac{1}{R_{1+2}} + \frac{1}{R_3}\right)^{-1}
        </me>. This has the form of Ohm's Law where <m>R_{1+2}</m> and <m>R_3</m> combine into an equivalent resistance
        <me>
            R_{(1+2)||3}^{-1}=R_{1+2}^{-1}+R_3^{-1}
        </me>.
        We say that resistors <m>R_{1+2}</m> and <m>R_3</m> are in parallel because the potential difference across each 
        resistor must be identical as each side of the resistors are connected together by wires. An equivalent resistance 
        for a combination of any number of parallel resistors can be found using
