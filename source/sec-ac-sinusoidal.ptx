        In this chapter, we will focus on circuit behavior that results from sinusoidal signals
        <md>
            <mrow>V(t) =\amp V_0 \cos\left(\omega t + \delta_V\right) </mrow>
            <mrow>I(t) =\amp I_0 \cos\left(\omega t + \delta_I\right)</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>\omega=2\pi f=2\pi/T</m> is the angular frequency, <m>f</m> is the frequency, <m>T</m> is the period, and <m>\delta_V, \delta_I</m> are the phase of the signals at time <m>t=0</m>. (We could have used the sine function instead of cossine, but these are the same function but shifted from each other by <m>\pm\pi/2</m> radians in their arguments.)
    </p>

        While it may seem like focusing on a sinusoidal signal with a single frequency will limit the applicability of the analysis we develop in this chapter, this is not actually the case. Fourier's Theorem states that any well-behaved function can be represented by an integral (sum) of sinusoidal signals.
        <me>
            I(t)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} a(\omega) \cos\left(\omega t + \delta_I(\omega)\right) \text{d}\omega
        </me>
        where <m>a(\omega)</m> and <m>\delta_I(\omega)</m> are weights and phase shifts for each <m>\omega</m> value. We can use the trigonometric identity
        <me>
            \cos\left(\omega t + \delta_I\right) = \cos(\omega t)\cos\left(\delta_I(\omega)\right) + \sin(\omega t)\sin\left(\delta_I(\omega)\right)
        </me>
        to express this in a more common form
        <me>
            I(t)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[a(\omega) \cos\left(\omega t\right)  + b(\omega) \cos\left(\omega t\right)\right]\text{d}\omega
        </me>
        where <m>\cos\left(\delta_I(\omega)\right)</m> has been absorbed into the <m>a(\omega)</m> variable and <m>b(\omega)=\sin\left(\delta_I(\omega)\right)</m> and .      
    </p>
    <p>
        Since any general (well-behaved) function of time can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal signals, we can use the superposition theorem to find the response of a linear circuit to a general time signal. If we examine the behavior of a linear circuit in response to a single sinusoidal signal with frequency <m>\omega</m>, we can then use superposition to add up (integrate) responses for many sinusoidal signals (each with its own <m>\omega</m>), weighting the results in the sum using the same weighting factors that appear above.
    </p>

        Thus, it is sufficient to examine the response of linear circuits to a single sinusoidal signal. INCLUDE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SINE/COSINE SERIES
