        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The operation of many electronic devices depend on a DC voltage source, but the electricity delivered to households in the United States is 60-Hz AC voltage. Today, we'll explore one method of converting AC voltage to DC voltage using the <term>bridge full-wave rectifier</term> with a smoothing capacitor as pictured in <xref ref="fig-labactivities-diode-ac2dc-circuit"/>. 
            <figure xml:id="fig-labactivities-diode-ac2dc-circuit">
                <caption></caption>
                <image width="70%"><latex-image>
                    <xi:include parse="text" href="./figures/fig-labactivities-diode-ac2dc-circuit.ptx" />
                </latex-image></image>
            </figure>
           This circuit converts an AC input voltage to a nearly-constant output voltage, though a small <sq>ripple</sq> will remain. Larger values of smoothing capacitance will reduce the size of this ripple and thus will improve the quality of the DC voltage output. High-capacitance capacitors are typically more expensive and physically larger than small capacitors, so there is incentive to keep the capacitance as small as possible. Thus, devices that require DC voltages often specify a maximum ripple size that they can tolerate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your goal in this experiment is to predict the optimal smoothing capacitance one would use to ensure a 5% ripple on <m>V_\text{out}</m>. The ripple size depends on the smoothing capacitance (which you will determine), the input signal frequency (which we will assume to be 120-Hz) and the load resistance provided by the device across the output (here, represented by the 3.3-k<m>\Omega</m> resistor).
        </p> 

        <p>
            Before conducting the experiment, be sure to review the behavior of the unsmoothed bridge full-wave rectifier circuit in <xref ref="sec-diode-rectifier"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>NOTE:</alert> One downside of the circuit shown in <xref ref="fig-labactivities-diode-ac2dc-circuit"/> is that neither <m>V_\text{out}</m> terminal is connected to ground. This means that we cannot simply connect a single oscilloscope probe across <m>V_\text{out}</m> since the ground provided by the oscilloscope and the ground provided by the function generator would conflict. In practice, this issue can be resolved by using a <sq>floating</sq> function generator where the output is isolated from ground, or to use a transformer between the function generator and rectifier circuit. We will use a simpler solution and use the oscilloscope to measure <m>V_2</m> on CH1, <m>V_1</m> on CH2, and then use the MATH oscilloscope feature to display <m>V_\text{out}=V_2-V_1=\text{CH1}-\text{CH2}</m>.

            Once you've reviewed the above information, complete the following steps.
        </p>    
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use your DMM to determine exact values for your resistor and your capacitors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <alert>Warning:</alert> The capacitors that you are using are called <sq>electrolytic capacitors</sq> and are polarized, meaning that they only work when the negative lead (often marked with a negative sign) is at a lower voltage than the positive lead. When measuring the capacitance with the DMM, connect the COM to the negative capacitor lead. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Unplug your prototyping board. You will not need to plug it in for this experiment.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Construct the circuit shown in <xref ref="fig-labactivities-diode-ac2dc-circuit"/> on your prototyping board. Use the smallest capacitor value that you've been given as your smoothing capacitor. The input voltage <m>V_\text{in}</m> will be provided by your function generator.

                <p>
                    <alert>Warning: Pay attention to the capacitor polarity in the circuit schematic. If you wire the capacitor in backward, you can destroy the capacitor (sometimes resulting in a puff of smoke or small flame). Remember that in this circuit, <m>V_2 \gt V_1</m> always.</alert>
