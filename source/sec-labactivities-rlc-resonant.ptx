            We developed the theory for this circuit in <xref ref="sec-ac-phasor-example-rlc-resonant-circuit"/>. In your lab notebook, summarize the main theoretical results/circuit behaviors that you expect to observe today. To guide you, here are a few questions you may wish to address:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What voltage gain and phase behaviors do you expect to observe as <m>\omega\rightarrow 0</m>?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        At what frequency <m>f_0</m> do you expect the highest voltage gain? Express your answer as a function of variables <m>L</m> and <m>C</m> and show your work. What do you expect voltage gain and phase to be at frequency <m>f_0</m>?

            In your lab notebook, describe a procedure that you intend to follow to make measurements of voltage gain <m>G_V</m> and the phase difference between output and input voltages <m>\phi=\phi_\text{out}-\phi_\text{in}</m>. Here are a few questions you may wish to consider:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How will you confirm the values associated with your circuit components? <alert>Note:</alert> You will be unable to verify the inductance <m>L</m>, but you should be able to measure values for other components.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In this experiment, you will need to measure <m>V_\text{in}</m>, <m>V_\text{out}</m>, and <m>\phi=\phi_\text{out}-\phi_\text{in}</m> for many values of frequency increasing from 200~Hz.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What equipment do you intend to use as a voltage source?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What equipment do you intend to use to measure the desired quantities?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If using the oscilloscope, describe the functionality that will be used (e.g. cursors, <sq>MEASURE</sq> functions, etc.). Why did you make your choice?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Plan to display your results on a plot with a logarithmic frequency axis and a linear Gain and phase axis using the <c>semilogx</c> command instead of the <c>plot</c> command.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        At how many frequencies will you take data? How are you going to determine measurement spacing?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    When determining your answers to this question, consider that you likely don't need a high density of data points in regions where you expect little variation in <m>G_V</m> and <m>\phi</m>, but you will want a higher density of data points in regions where you expect high variation in these quantities.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    To determine frequency ranges associated with high and low variation in gain and phase, it can be helpful to perform a quick informal scan of experimental parameters to find the experimental resonant frequency while not actually recording gain and phase measurements. With this information, you can better determine the distribution of frequencies at which to record data.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Since you will be using a logarithmic horizontal axis, your frequency selections should take this into account.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How will you identify when you are at or near the resonant frequency?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        When comparing to theoretical predictions, use the equations that result from the analysis in <xref ref="sec-ac-phasor-example-rlc-resonant-circuit"/> to generate theoretical curves for <m>G_V</m> and <m>\phi</m> vs frequency, plotting the theoretical curves as a different colored line on the same axes as the experimental data in each case.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Build your circuit on the prototyping board. When laying out your circuit, it can be useful to build it in a way that is clean and similar to the circuit diagram when possible. See <xref ref="img-labactivities-rlc-resonant-layout"/> for an illustration of how one may do this.

            As you proceed to conduct your experiment, discuss any changes you have to make to your procedure and the reason for those changes. Additionally, if you observe some behavior that you were not expecting or that confuses you, make a note of it in your notebook. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Reminder on oscilloscope operation:</alert> Before recording any measurement values into your notebook, you must first 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        center each signal vertically on the oscilloscope display and adjust the vertical scaling on each channel so that the signals are magnified as much as possible on the screen.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        adjust the timebase so that there are 3-5 cycles displayed on the oscilloscope screen. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            You should ensure these optimal settings are satisfied <alert>for each frequency</alert> at which you take data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Tip:</alert> Your starting input voltage should be sinusoidal with amplitude <m>V_{\text{in},0}=10\text{V}_\text{pp}</m> and an initial frequency of <m>f=200</m>Hz. 
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the experiment above, return to the resonance frequency that you observed and do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Make sure you always turn off the circuit power when moving probes or changing components!

                    <p>
                        Move the oscilloscope Channel 2 probe to the node marked X on the circuit diagram.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Make sure that both channels have the same VOLTS/DIV settings.

                    <p>
                        What options can you think of to compare theory to experiment in this lab? 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What option(s) did you choose for your comparison of theory to experiment? Why did you make the choice that you did?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Address any discrepancies that you may have seen along with any issues you may have run into. Speculate regarding solutions/explanations related to these discrepancies/issues. This lab has been designed such that there <alert>will</alert> be discrepancies between observation and our theory. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Part of this is because there may be a discrepancy between the quoted inductance value <m>L</m> and the actual inductance of your physical component. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We must also confront the idea that real inductors do not necessarily behave as nicely as the ideal inductors that we discuss in class. The behavior of a real inductor can be better approximated by an inductance <m>L_\text{inductor}</m> in series with an internal resistance <m>R_\text{inductor}</m>, and then that combination in parallel with a parasitic capacitance <m>C_\text{inductor}</m>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
