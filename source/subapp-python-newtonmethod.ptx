    <title> Newton's Method </title>

    <p>
        Newton's method is a computational algorithm that can be used to find the roots of an equation. Let's illustrate with an example.
        <figure xml:id="fig-python-newtonmethodplot">

        </figure>
        In <xref ref="fig-python-newtonmethodplot"/>, the solid blue line represents the function <m>f(x)</m>. Assume that <m>x^*</m> is an unknown root of <m>f(x)</m> such that <m>f(x^*)=0</m>. We may be able to guess at an approximate value of the root <m>x=x_0</m>, but this is unlikely to be very precise. Exmining <xref ref="fig-python-newtonmethodplot"/>, we can see that we can find a better approximation of the function's root by using a straight-line (dashed red curve) with the same slope as our function at the location of our initial guess, 
        <me>
            f'(x_0) = \frac{f(x_0)-0}{x_0-x_1}
        </me>
        which can be rearranged to find our new estimate
        <me>
            x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
        </me>
        
        We'll call this new approximated root <m>x_1</m>. It's very possible that this new guess still lacks the precision that we desire, so we can repeat the process again, iterating as many times as we desire  using
        <me>
            x_{n}=x_{n-1} - \frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})}
        </me>
        until <m>\left|x_n-x_{n-1}\right|</m> is less than some user-defined tolerance that defines the desired precision, as the change in the estimate to our root from one iteration to the next should become smaller as our estimate approaches the real value of the function's root. Note that this method requires knowledge of the functional form of our function <m>f(x)</m> as well as knowledge of or the ability to calculate the analytic form of <m>f'(x)</m>    
    </p>

        A word of caution: Newton's method is not foolproof and it can fail sometimes. Please take a look at other computational methods textbooks or webpages to investigate these failure modes. For the purposes of this text, try several different initial guesses if your first choice leads to a failure of the method.
