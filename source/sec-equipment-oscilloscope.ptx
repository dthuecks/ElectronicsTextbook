    <p>
        The oscilloscope is an extremely versatile instrument. It can be used to measure both steady and time-dependent voltages, frequency, time duration, phase difference, and harmonic distortion. Some oscilloscopes automatically test transistors, perform spectral analysis, integrate, differentiate, sum, subtract, filter, and store electrical signals. Anyone working in an experimental science should be able to use an oscilloscope with considerable confidence.

    <p>
        The oscilloscopes that we are using in lab (BK Precision 2542B or 2190E) are general-purpose, two-channel digital storage instruments capable of displaying and capturing electrical signals with frequencies up to 100 MHz. Its front panel can be divided into a number of sections:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The color LCD display shows the signal on one or more of the two input channels, using a different color for each channel.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A set of buttons along the right hand side of the display are used to make menu item selections.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A set of buttons and knobs on the right half of the instrument control some of the advanced oscilloscope functions, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                a TRIGGER section that permits one to control the starting point for the displayed waveform,
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                a VERTICAL section, accepting up to two input signals and containing controls to vary the voltage resolution (among other things),
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                a HORIZONTAL or ‘time base’ section that controls the time resolution of the display.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In its most commonly used mode of operation, an oscilloscope creates a visual display by capturing and successively overlaying identical windows of time, each window beginning at the same point (relative to the ‘trigger point’) on the signal. The time base of the scope determines how much time is represented by each horizontal division of the LCD display. The triggering function determines when each time window is to begin; proper triggering is necessary for stable, unambiguous display of the desired waveform. Finally, the vertical section of the scope controls the amplitude of the information displayed. It determines for each of the two channels how many volts are represented by each vertical division on the display.

                                Autoset: scope tries to choose overall best scope settings (sometimes useful when you can’t see anything, but generally used as a last resort because it can also mislead you.

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                You can select various measurements and which channel to measure. Be very careful with automatic measurements (again these can be deceptive). Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements. Note that the automatic mode searches for the very top and bottom of the signals (when measuring voltages) which may not provide an accurate value for the actual amplitude as noise on the signal may artificially inflate the max/min values.
