        <p>
            To date we have used only linear circuit elements in lab: resistors, capacitors, and inductors. In this experiment, we take up the diode, a nonlinear device. Diodes provide signal conditioning, voltage regulation, and the conversion of AC voltages and currents into DC. In this experiment, you will measure a silicon diode’s “I-V characteristic” using the circuit pictured in <xref ref="fig-labactivities-diodes-iv-circuit"/>.

        <title>EXPERIMENT</title>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            In this experiment, you need to collect many data points to construct the I-V characteristic for your diode. You can either do this using a DC supply for your input, collecting point-by-point the diode voltage drop <m>V_D</m> and associated diode current <m>I_D</m> as you vary the DC supply. This process is very slow. So, we will instead use a sinusoidal voltage source as <m>V_\text{in}</m> and collect time traces for <m>V_D</m> and <m>I_D</m>. We will export this data to a computer and then use Python to generate the I-V characteristic.

                    Unplug your prototyping board. You will not need to plug it in for this experiment.

                    Obtain a 1N4001 silicon diode and test its function with the multimeter set to its diode-testing mode. In this mode, the DMM checks the effective resistance of a diode by attempting to force a positive current out through its <sq>+</sq> or red lead, through the external diode, and back into its <sq>-</sq> or black lead. When the DMM displays a small result such as 0.5, one may infer that the red lead is connected to the anode (or p-type semiconductor) and the black lead to the cathode (or n-type semiconductor) of the diode, and that the diode is conducting in its <sq>easy</sq> direction. If, instead, a large off-scale indication of <sq>.OL</sq> is displayed, then the diode is reverse-biased. Note how the diode is marked to indicate which end is the anode.

                    Connect your waveform generator to your circuit and set it to produce a 60Hz sinusoidal signal that varies between <m>\pm 5</m>V.

                    Save your data to a USB flash drive. The oscilloscope can export data in several formats. For our purposes it is best to save and export the actual digitally sampled data points (as opposed to an image file of the display) so that we can plot, manipulate, and analyze the data using a program like Excel or LoggerPro. This requires that we save the data in channels one and two separately.

                                Press the RUN/STOP button to capture the data and to make sure that you are saving the data you want.

                                Insert your flash drive into the USB port on the front of the oscilloscope.

                                Press the SAVE/LOAD button and, from the menu options figure out how to save the CH1 and CH2 data (in separate files) to a spreadsheet format file (such as a .csv file). Make note of the filename for each channel. The instructions depend on the oscilloscope type. Try one of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                            SAVE/RECALL <m>\rightarrow</m> TYPE (CSV), press <sq>Confirm</sq> and follow the rest of the menu options to save a new file.
